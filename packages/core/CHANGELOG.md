# @devix-cli/core

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 3a98d3f: Advertised versions no longer drift from releases: `DEVIX_VERSION` and the docker plugin version are now read from each package's own manifest instead of hardcoded literals. Docker plugin tests get generous timeouts and concurrent probes so slow Windows CI runners no longer time out.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First public release: the Devix CLI (`npm i -g devix-cli`) with `status`, `detect`, `doctor`, read-only `git` commands, dependency delegation through the detected package manager, Docker diagnostics with graceful degradation, and the `@devix-cli/*` service packages powering them.
- b0e371a: Adds a minimal plugin API to `@devix-cli/core`: `PluginRegistry` validates `PluginManifest` metadata (id, name, semantic version, description, declared commands) and rejects duplicates. The API is metadata-only and never loads dynamic code. The CLI gains `devix plugin list`, which lists the builtin plugins (docker) through that registry with a `--json` flag.
